# Spanning tree 

A spanning tree T of an undirected graph G is a subgraph that is a tree which includes all of the vertices of G. 
If a graph is not connected, it has spanning forests, but no spanning tree. 
A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is minimum. 
A maximum leaf spanning tree is a spanning tree that has the largest possible number of leaves among all spanning trees of G.

# Applications

Some routing protocols require each router to remember a spanning tree to avoid bridge loops and “routing loops“. 
Examples of such protocols include Spanning Tree Protocol, Open Shortest Path First, Link-state routing protocol,
Augmented tree-based routing.
Several pathfinding algorithms internally build a spanning tree as an intermediate step to solve the problem, 
such as Dijkstra’s algorithm and the A* search algorithm.
Minimize the cost of power networks, wiring connections, piping, etc. Such problems can be boiled down to the minimum spanning tree.
